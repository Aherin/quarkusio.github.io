By default all categories are configured with `INFO` minimum level. To get runtime logging below `INFO`, e.g. `DEBUG` or `TRACE`, the minimum level has to be adjusted at build time, the right log level needs to be provided at runtime. As an example, to get `TRACE` logging, minimum level needs to be at `TRACE` and the runtime log level needs to match that. To get `DEBUG` logging, minimum level needs to be set at `DEBUG` or `TRACE` (as well as runtime log level).","withinAMap":false,"defaultValue":"inherit","javaDocSiteLink":"","docMapKey":"min-level","configPhase":"BUILD_TIME","acceptedValues":null,"optional":false,"list":false,"passThroughMap":false,"withinAConfigGroup":true,"topLevelGrouping":""}}]
