== Tourism and Covid-19
It's not new that the tourism industry is one the most affected industries from the Covid-19 pandemic. Hotels, restaurants, airlines, cruises are some of the businesses that had a really tough time this summer. Many countries, especially those whose economies rely on tourism, were looking for solutions in order to open up the borders for tourists while not  imposing their citizens to a great health risk. There are no magic solutions here but there is always room for doing your best to satisfy both requirements.

The Greek government decided at some point to open up the borders in order to help the economy but it would be too reckless to do it without precautions and measures. That’s why they decided to build a system based on advanced technology that would choose the right travelers for Covid-19 testing. The idea is the following: if you cannot afford to test everyone then you should test those who are more likely to be positive to a Covid-19 test. This way the Greek state can use their resources wisely and at the same time save money for tests.

The question is how. And this is the part that we entered the scene. The AI and machine learning algorithm was already proposed by a team of scientists. Its ambition was to cover exactly the need described above by efficiently choosing the right people to be tested. But these algorithms need data and at that point detailed data from the passengers entering the country were not available in any digital and organized form.


== The basic idea
The Greek government assigned our company, https://www.cytechmobile.com/[Cytech], to build a software that would gather the information from the passengers, filter it and pass it to all involved parties so they can do their job. One of them was the machine learning system called EVA. But the list with the parties needing this information is much longer: it includes the civil protection agency, the ministry of health, border agents, airlines etc. At the same time it would send an email to each of the passengers to inform them that their application is under review. When EVA would come up with the result it would send it back to us so we can email passengers the final document. Without it, their entrance in the country would not be permitted. To make a long story short, our job was to build a demanding https://travel.gov.gr[web form] to gather all passengers data but the most important part was to build a Data Broker capable of exchanging the right data with all the other information systems emphasizing on speed, robustness and resilience. 

== Technical challenges and solutions
The requirements of the Broker platform for the https://travel.gov.gr[Passenger Locator Form] project's backend mainly revolved around exposing REST API endpoints for the UI to consume, as well as interconnect with government-related 3rd parties for required data exchange, such as EVA, EODY (National Public Health Organization), GGPP (the General Secretariat for Civil Protection) and the Greek COVID19 patients registry. Also, in order to be delivered in line within the extreme deadlines we had, as well as being able to cover the large-scale needs of the project, we also required our tools to be mature and proven and provide us with developer productivity, (horizontal) scalability and maximum efficiency/performance with the minimum possible resources.

We had positive experience with Quarkus in the past with small scale projects, but we were already impressed with its features for ease of use and increased productivity. Since Quarkus is based on industry standards (Microprofile and Jakarta EE apis), it was very easy for our developers to get up to speed very quickly and within the very tight deadlines. Also, the Guides section on Quarkus’s website really helped getting immediate feedback on the few parts that did not auto-magically work as expected.

Live reload and very fast startup felt like a very fresh start on developing enterprise-quality, very-large-scale applications in Java. Any change on the backend application was immediately reflected in the next request. Given that our choice for the application’s UI was Vue.js, offering the same functionality, every change across the application was reloaded live as it happened!

== Quarkus: a game changer

An application with such critical impact is required to be robust. There was simply no room for outages of any kind, as that would mean people being rejected entering our country, or even being deported at the borders! Testing is a first-class citizen in the Quarkus development lifecycle, and that enabled us to increase robustness and confidence in the application in minimal time. Testing the application under production circumstances was as easy as annotating the test class with @QuarkusTest and also handling the database using @QuarkusTestResource and Testcontainers. We were able to achieve very high code coverage and (most importantly) not only on the easy paths, but deep down to every part of the application. This played a huge role in the application’s 100% uptime and availability, from the moment it was first deployed and exposed to the public.

We valued the versatility of a Quarkus application’s configuration, based on the Microprofile Config API, which uses a unified configuration convention and offers the ability to easily plug in dynamic configuration sources. It assisted us a lot on our project which included many dynamically and rapidly changing parts, such as cap limits for specific country entry points, or requirements from passengers coming from specific countries to carry a negative RT-PCR test with them. One of our platform’s main functions was the accurate, on-time data dispatch to concerned government parties. Using the dynamic configuration capabilities, we were able to easily isolate, pause and resume on demand the integration parts that started accumulating failures due to 3rd party handling errors.

A website that must be visited by every person entering Greece, especially during the tourist season, is - as can be easily guessed - quite high traffic. There were thousands of concurrent unique users at any point in time, with many thousands of forms submitted per day. We needed the application to handle most of the traffic with minimal resources, as well as being able to scale out if/when needed, such as during midnight, when the results from EVA came in and the platform needed to process with extreme urgency the final form for each passenger, generating the QR code and the accompanying PDF file with all the form information and submit it via email. Quarkus minimal resource usage allowed us to scale to 2 c5.large (2 vcpus and 4GB memory) AWS EC2 instances for the vast majority of the time, with CPU usage usually being under 10%. During QR code generation time, the platform scaled out to 4 c5.large EC2 instances, with CPU usage around 80%, while handling more than 10000 QR codes/PDF/emails per minute.

We served about 4M PLFs - from July to September - from travelers coming from almost every country of the world. The forms were accompanied by their respective email notifications, PDFs and QR codes during the high summer season providing tourists with low risk access to the country, efficient risk management and optimal allocation of covid-19 test resources, locking in at high-risk countries as fast as possible, as well as providing early warnings for destinations. At the same time we communicate with 10 different information systems feeding them valuable information about passengers, without downtime or performance degradation. We supported the difficult job of the health experts so they got the right decisions for the country and we were there when information was necessary in order to confine the spread of the virus to the community. It was and still is an exciting and at the same time stressful journey that shows the unique role technology can play for solving very crucial problems for society.
